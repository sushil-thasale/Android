The colors of the Taj Mahal change at different hours of the day and during different seasons. The Taj Mahal of Agra is pinkish in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden when the moon shines.

Today this symbol of colonialism has got Indianised, drawing droves of local tourists and citizens. Behind the arch, there are steps leading down to the water. Here, you can get onto one of the bobbing little motor launches, for a short cruise through Mumbai's splendid natural harbor.

The intimidating structure stands 43 meters or 140 feet on the pedestal and a cool 54 feet above the ground. The gateway is approached by a steep flight of 42 steps, which add height and majesty to the entire structure. Buland Darwaza that is counted as one of the tallest gateways in the world is almost entirely made out of the red-sandstone with a generous dose of marble decoration on it.

The calligraphy work done on the inner façade of Buland Darwaza has very less parallels in India. Buland Darwaza has a very famous inscription written on it. This inscription is actually a quote attributed to Jesus Christ, who is revered equally by both Christians as well as Muslims.

The whole place brims with preserved vestiges of Buddhist architectural legerdemain, from the 3rd century BC to the 12th century AD. Due to their beauty preserved across centuries, the historical monuments of Sanchi find incorporation in the World Heritage Sites enlistment. The most significant of all these monuments is the Great Sanchi Stupa.Generally, stupas are large hemispherical domes with a central chamber, used for interring the holy relics of the Buddha. Thus, the Great Sanchi Stupa, or Stupa Number One, also serves as a chasse or a monstrance. Built by Emperor Ashoka, in 3rd century BC, the nub of the stupa is a hemispherical dome of brick, built over the sacred relics of the Buddha and sheltered by a parasol. Sungas sabotaged this beautiful stupa during the 2nd century BC, only to refurbish it during the later years of their regime.During the Sunga rule, the stupa was enlarged to twice its original size. Three parasols, within a railing, decked its top, like a dazzling tiara. The three-tiered structure formed the symbol of the Dharma, or the Wheel of Law. Beautiful stones festooned its facades. In addition, railings, staircase and a harmika were also added to the structure. Later, during the Satavahana period, the stupa was further beautified, with carved gateways (toranas) and ornamental balustrades displaying various motifs. Today, the railings girdle a path for circumambulation around the stupa, with four gates facing each direction.Nevertheless, the most distinguished feature of the Stupa is the way Lord Buddha finds representation here. Instead of an image, he has been represented by various symbols like footprints, wheels, thrones etc. Moreover, the four gateways that flank the stupa contain elaborate depiction of various incidents from the life of the Buddha. They also delineate his previous incarnations as mentioned in the Jataka tales. Due to its historical, architectural and religious importance, this Great Sanchi Stupa is today acclaimed as one of the best Buddhist stupas found across India."
19,Dhamekh Stupa,Varanasi,Uttar Pradesh,,"Anytime round the year,From Sunrise to sunset",25.380902,83.024515,"Dhamek Stupa in Sarnath is one of the most visited and most revered Buddhist Shrines in the world. Dhamek Stupa marks the place where Lord Buddha gave away his first sermon after he got enlightened in Bodh Gaya. Dhamek Stupa is arguably the most remarkable structure at Sarnath. Typical of Stupas of that period, Dhamek is cylindrical in shape with a base that is more than 28 meters in diameter. The Stupa stands 31.3 meters above the pedestal whereas the entrance measures 43.6 meters on its feet. Dhamek Stupa that was originally commissioned during Mauryan period is made partly out of red bricks and stones. The architectural pattern of Dhamek Stupa is distinct in itself. Numerous excavation works have been carried out in and around this structure that was first started by Colonel Cunningham of Royal British Army in early 20th century. The decorative patterns on the trunk of Stupa are mesmerizing. Panels that are carved with geometric and floral designs mark the trunk of Dhamek Stupa. The design also consists of a broad band of Swastika (fylfot). These Swastikas have been carved in different geometrical patterns with a finely chiseled lotus wreath, running over and below it. It has also been reveled that the structure was expanded and enlarged as many as 12 times in the course of history. It is interesting to note that successive patrons of this shrine have each added and embellished the original shrine. The main area has been enclosed and consists of a labyrinth of half-ruined monasteries and votive Stupas.It can be safely claimed that Dhamek Stupa is the most conspicuous structure at Sarnath. During the initial excavation, a stone tablet was unearthed that reveled that the name of this Stupa is Dhamek and it marks the place where Lord Buddha gave his first sermon. It is generally agreed upon by the historians that the word Dhamek is a distorted form of Dharma Chakra that means turning the wheel of the Dharma. Some also claim, with the help of Prakrit sources that Dhamek is the very spot where the five ascetics who left Gautam Buddha in Bodh Gaya used to live in huts.Several dignitaries as well as other pilgrims of Buddhist countries visit this place for circumambulation of this sacred Stupa. The pattern of worship followed by the Tibetans is different from other Buddhists. Tibetans Buddhist circumambulates Stupa counter-clockwise chanting the mantra 'Om mani padme hum'. It is worth knowing that the first discourse of the Buddha was on the 'Wheel of Law'. This is the possible reasoning behind the naming of this Stupa."

Each cell was 4.5 metres x 2.7 metres or 13.5x7.5 feet in size with a ventilator located at a height of three metres.[10] The name, ""cellular jail"", derived from the solitary cells which prevented any prisoner from communicating with any other.

The colossal fort stands surrounded by the hills, which further add to its mysterious appeal and grandeur.It is believed Golkunda Fort was erected out of mud by Kakatiya rulers in the 12th century.

The shrine consists of Darbar Sahib, which is surrounded by the Holy Tank (Amrit Sarovar). It was constructed under the aegis of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the Fifth Sikh Guru. He wanted to build a common place of worship for the Sikhs, providing a common platform where all the Sikhs could gather and offer prayer to the Almighty. This wish initiated the idea of constructing Golden Temple and subsequently, he designed the architecture of the temple. Prior to him, Guru Amardas Sahib, the third Guru, had planned the excavation of the Holy Tank (Amrit Sarovar), but it was executed only by Guru Ramdas Sahib, under the supervision of Baba Budha Ji.The earlier Guru Sahibs acquired the site from the Zamindars (landlords) of native villages. The plan to establish a town settlement was also made. Therefore, the construction work on the Sarovar (The Tank) and the town started simultaneously in 1570. The tank was excavated in 1577 A.D. and was subsequently called ""Amritsar”, meaning the pool of the nectar of immortality. This contributed in naming the city, which grew around it (Amritsar). In due course, a splendid Sikh edifice, Darbar Sahib (Temple of God) was constructed in the middle of this tank, which became the prime centre of Sikhism.  The work on both projects was completed in 1577 A.D.Guru Arjan Dev Ji laid the foundation of Golden Temple with the help of a Muslim saint Hazrat Mian Mir Ji of Lahore, on 1st of Magh (December, 1588). The construction work was directly supervised by Guru Arjan Sahib, with the assistance of prominent Sikh personalities like Baba Budha Ji, Bhai Gurdas Ji, Bhai Sahlo Ji and many other devoted Sikhs. Guru Arjan Sahib built the building on the lower level, unlike the traditional Hindu Temple architecture, where it is normally built on a higher structure.Golden Temple deviated from a temple in another aspect, by being open from all four sides, rather than having only one gate for both entrance and exit. This symbolized the dawn of a new faith, which embraces people without any distinction of caste, creed, sex and religion. The building work was completed in 1604 A.D and Guru Arjan Dev Ji installed the Adi Granth in it. He appointed Baba Budha ji as its first Granthi i.e. the reader of Guru Granth Sahib.

53,Badrinath,Chamoli,Uttarakhnda,,all day of the week,30.7433085,79.4937634,"Badrinath Temple is considered the holiest of the Char Dham Hindu pilgrimage in Uttarakhand. It is delicately placed between the mountains of Nar and Narayan with River Alaknanda flowing peacefully beside it. It is known as Badrinath since the entire region is covered with Badri trees (Indian Jujube).The temple and the town are situated at an altitude of 3,133 meters above sea level. The present temple was constructed approximately two centuries ago by Garhwal Kings. The temple has three parts- Garbha Griha (the sanctum sanctorum), Darshan Mandap (for pujas) and Shobha Mandap (for devotees to assemble). Badrinath is located about 301 kms north of Rishikesh in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. Badrinath is talked about in the Hindu scriptures as Badari or Badarikasram. This place is consecrated to Vishnu and particularly to Vishnu's dual form of Nara-Narayana. Another legend has it that when Goddess Ganga, the celestial river, was appealed by Bhagiratha to come down to Earth and help suffering humanity, the Earth was not capable to endure the power of her plunge. Consequently Ganga was divided into twelve sacred waterways, Alaknanda (in Badrinath) being one of them.It later became the abode of Lord Vishnu or Badrinath when he performed penance here and Ma Lakshmi took the form of Badri or Indian Jujube to provide sustenance to him. The mountains around Badrinath are mentioned in the Mahabharata as Swargarohini, the mount from where the Pandavas ascended into heaven. Just four kms from Badrinath is the Mana cave in which Ved Vyas, it is said, wrote the Mahabharata.The temple is just about 50 ft (15 m) tall with a petite cupola on top, enclosed with a gold gilt roof.

This centre of pilgrimage was established by Adi Guru Shankaracharya in 9th century. Situated at an altitude of 3,580 m (11,750 ft) within the picturesque Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, this renowned Hindu pilgrimage destination in the high Himalaya Mountains is devoted to Lord Shiva.

During the closure period of the temple, worship of Sri Kedarnath is continued at Okhimath in winter by the priest from the Kedarnath Temple.There are many stories associated with the manifestation and worship of Kedarnath. According to one legend, Nar and Narayan, two incarnations of Lord Vishnu did severe penance at Badrikashram in front of a Shiva lingam to please lord Shiva. So when lord Shiva gave them ‘Darshan’ they requested him to make Kedarnath his permanent abode. Fulfilling their wish he manifested himself in the form of a Jyotirlinga there. The second legend is of the Panch Kedar. When Arjuna and the Pandavas used the ‘Pashupatra’ weapon to kill their kins turned mortal enemies, they felt guilty and sought advice from Lord Krishna. He suggested them to search lord Shiva in the Garhwal region. Lord Shiva however turned into a Bull to avoid detection. Nevertheless, after a long search the Pandavas found him but Shiva sank into the earth but not before Bhim could grab his (bull’s) hump. Shiva relented and granted them the boon of salvation from their sins. This hump is now hypothetically the Shiva lingam worshipped in the temple. "
55,Gangotri,Uttarkashi,Uttarakhnda,,all day of the week,30.9946945,78.9398402,"Gangotri is the place of the origin of the holy River Ganges, drawing thousands of pilgrims every year. Gangotri is the earthly throne of Goddess Ganga and is one of the four sites of the sacred Char Dham circuit. It is situated at an altitude of 3,753 m (about 12,313 ft). The ‘new-born’ river is called Bhagirathi at the source and acquires the name Ganga from Devprayag onwards, where it meets the Alaknanda River. Ganga originates at Gaumukh in the Gangotri Glacier which is a 19 km trek from Gangotri. Gangotri gives the excitement of conquering nature combined with a person’s spiritual awakening.Gangotri is a town in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand. It is approximately 300 km from Dehradun, 250 km from Rishikesh and 105 km from Uttarkashi. Gangotri Temple, constructed in the 18th Century, is dedicated to Goddess Ganga. Near the temple is located a sacred stone where King Bhagiratha is said to have worshipped Lord Shiva. Ganga is believed to have touched earth at this spot. The temple is a beautiful 20 ft high structure made of white granite. Gaumukh is about 18 kms is the proboscis of the Gangotri Glacier and is the source of the Bhagirathi River. Pilgrims have to trek upto the sacred spot on foot or they have the option of going on ponies to take a holy dip in the ice-cold water. The Bhavishya Badri Temple is another must visit in Gangotri. Located in the woodlands, the Bhavishya Badri stands at a distance of approximately 17 km east of Joshimath. The statue of Narasingha (the Lion headed God), an avatar of Lord Vishnu, is worshipped here. Mythically it is said that one day all the routes to the present Badrinath will be unapproachable and then Lord Badrinath will be worshipped at this place and this is why the place is called Bhavishya or Future Badri.According to an ancient legend, Lord Shiva was very happy with King Bhagiratha’s penance and took Ganga in his matted hair before she came down to earth. This supposedly broke her pride of being a celestial river and instilled a sense of helping humanity in her. It was then negotiated that Goddess Uma or Parvati, Shiva's wife, would have her daily bath in the Ganges and only then would she descend on the earth. The sanctified stone near the Gangotri temple denotes the place where Ganga first came down to earth. Since it was due to the efforts of Bhagiratha that Ganga came down to earth, she spiritually became his daughter. Hence the river is also called by the name of Bhagirathi (Bhagiratha’s daughter). "
56,Yamunotri,Uttarkashi,Uttarakhnda,,all day of the week,30.9968657,78.4616526,"Yamunotri is the starting point of the holy River Yamuna. It is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal range of the Himalayas, balanced on the borders of Bandar-Poonch Parvat. The main attraction at Yamunotri is the temple dedicated to Goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal Sulphur springs, almost 7 km away at Jankichatti. The actual source of the river is a frozen lake (Sapt Rishi Kund) and glacier called the Champasar Glacier, situated on the Kalind Mountain, approximately a kilometer from the Sulphur springs.

The Yamunotri temple is located in the Uttarakashi district of Uttarakhand. The temple is located about ten kms trek from the town of Hanuman Chatti, with a break in Janaki Chatti.The Yamunotri temple opens on the auspicious day of the Akshya Tritiya, which usually falls during the last week of April or first week of May.

The region around Yamunotri remains cool even during summers. The winters are snow-bound and temperatures fall below 0º C. One is advised to carry light or heavy woolens depending on the time of visit. According to a legend, Sage Asit Muni had his hermitage here. Throughout his life he bathed daily in the waters of both Ganga and Yamuna. Gradually, unable to go to Gangotri during his old age, a stream of Ganga appeared opposite Yamunotri for him. Another legend says that Yamuna’s supposed frivolousness was due to her mother’s inability to look at Yamuna’s father, Lord Surya, in the eye due to his tremendous radiance. It is also said that if one bathes in the waters of Yamuna, the person ceases to die a painful death since Yamuna is the sister of Yama, the lord of death. "
